# 📈 RDS Cloud Monitoring & Alerts using CloudWatch + SNS

This project demonstrates how to monitor an Amazon RDS (MySQL) instance using Amazon CloudWatch and set up automated alerting through Amazon SNS. It’s built entirely using AWS Free Tier and simulates high CPU load from an EC2 instance to trigger CloudWatch alarms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ✅ **RDS (MySQL)** setup using Free Tier
- 📊 **CloudWatch Alarm** on `CPUUtilization`
- 🔔 **SNS Topic** for email notifications
- 🖥️ **EC2 (Ubuntu)** instance to simulate load using SQL `BENCHMARK()` command
- 📬 Real-time **email alert** when CPU usage threshold is crossed
